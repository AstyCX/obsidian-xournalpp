# Setting the Xournal++ Installation Path

If you run into the following error, or encounter any other issues, you might have to set the path to your Xournal++ installation manually.

```
```

## Defaults
The defaults are the following:
- Linux: `xournalpp`
- Windows: `c:\Program Files\Xournal++\bin\xournalpp.exe`
- MacOS: `Applications/Xournal++/Contents/MacOS/Xournal++.app`

By default, this plugin will try through all the above options.

## Manually Setting the Xournal++ Path
To manually set the Xournal++ installation path, open Obsidian and go to **Settings -> Xournal++** and set the path to whatever is right on your system.

### Find the Right Xournal++ Installation Path
To find the right installation path for your system, you need to find out where Xournal++ is installed to. On Windows you need to link to the `.exe` file, which is usually found in the `Program Files` folder. On MacOS you need to link to the `.app` file, usually whithin the `Applications` folder.
